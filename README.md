C++ Meetup Zürich - Building reusable libraries
===============================================

Slides and demo code of the talk *Building reusable libraries* as presented
in the C++ Meetup Zürich on 28th of September 2016.

Requirements
------------

To compile the demos, you will need two different compiler with two different
standard library implementations. If desired, I could provide a Docker image
with the required tools.

To build the PDF, a reasonably modern TeX-live distribution with xelatex is
required, as well as minted and pygmentize. Again, if desired, I could provide
a Docker image with the required tools.

Building
--------

Simply run `make` in the root source directory.
